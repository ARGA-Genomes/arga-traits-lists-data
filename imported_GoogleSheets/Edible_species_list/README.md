# ARGA Curation: Edible Species List

The **ARGA Curation: Edible Species List** has been generated by the Australian Reference Genome Atlas (ARGA) research team.

This list is used within the ARGA web application as a filter to support searching and browsing for species and their genomes.

The active version of the list may be downloaded from the ALA Lists service:  
https://lists.test.ala.org.au/list/681363e168ab293a5a947908

The ALA Lists version results from indexation of the original file against the ALA Taxonomy Name Matching Service, which interprets the ingested species name (from the `scientificName` column in the raw data), and provides:
- a new interpreted `scientificName` column,
- higher classification information,
- an ALA taxon identifier (GUID),
- match type,
- match rank.

**Note:** the original `scientificName` column is renamed in ALAâ€™s UI to ```Supplied Name```.

The newly parsed version of the file is registered under:

>**ListID:** `681363e168ab293a5a947908`

That file is ingested into the database underlying the ARGA index via the ALA List tool API service.

### Versioning

Older versions of this list are archived here and synced to our complementary OSF repository accessible at:
_ARGA Curated Data/ARGA: Edible Species metalist_ (https://osf.io/7egt9/).

The list is maintained and updated by the ARGA research team, and currently draws primarily from:

1. FSANZ Food Composition Database: Native Foods  
   https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/science/monitoringnutrients/afcd/Pages/default.aspx  
2. GRIN-Global World Economic Plants (US National Germplasm Resources Laboratory)

The primary source file is maintained as a private Google Sheet and synced to this repository in a versioned format via an automated Google Apps Script workflow.   A copy of this file is archived in the OSF repository.
