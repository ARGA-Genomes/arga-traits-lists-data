# ARGA traits lists data
This repo contains an archive of traits-based lists about Australian biodiversity species.  The lists are available as CSV documents and are ingested to the ALA Species Lists tool (https://lists.test.ala.org.au/).  The lists are then ingested into the ARGA index via an API from ALA Lists.
